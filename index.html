    <p> This is my cat Frankie, he was orginally my stepmom, but when we moved in together he became the family cat.
    <p> He is about 10 years old and was found as a kitten, in a box, during a storm.
    <p> This is my first guinea pig, Custard, she became part of my family on Apirl 28th, in 2016.
    <p> I begged to have a guinea pig and my mom aggreed.
